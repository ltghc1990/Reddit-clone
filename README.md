# Reddit clone project following tutorial done by Shadee Merhi on youtube

npm installs :

- Nextjs
- Firebase
- Chakra UI
- Framer motion
- Tailwind CSS
  -react-query

<!-- Things that need fixing -->
<!-- something funky going on when i hover the menu items on the directory
 -->
<!-- Issue with react query keys getting removed when I make use of the router object or Links. Right now, a temporary fix is adding a router.asPath key prop on the layout which forces a complete remount of all the components  -->
